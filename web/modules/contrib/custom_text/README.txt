DESCRIPTION
------------
The Custom Text module provides developers with a back-end to give customers
easy access to edit any text in the website.

Developers need to implement hook_custom_text_info() to provide an identifier
and a description for each text, and then they can use this text wherever they
choose by using custom_text_get($identifier).
