PayEx module for Drupal
=======================

[PayEx][] is one of the largest payment processors in Scandinavia. This
module provides integration with their payment gateway.

Note Drupal 8 version of module is still in very early alpha. A lot of the
ground systems are in place and works, but should not be considdered production
ready. Integration with commerce is very sketcy at best, since commerce doesn't
officially support off site payment gateway, which is what PayEx is. Under the
right circumstances it's possible to get it to work, but you need a deep
understanding of commerce and need to modify it to make everything work.
