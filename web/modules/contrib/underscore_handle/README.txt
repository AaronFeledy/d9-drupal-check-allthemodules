INTRODUCTION
============
This Module prevents field machine name from ending (_) underscore. For example, 
when you have brackets at the end of a label, e.g., "Address (2)", 
you end up with a trailing "_" character â€” field_address_2_.

Perhaps, you simply want to validate field the machine name, especially when it 
is ending with underscore or having two/more undersocre and it has been
truncated
