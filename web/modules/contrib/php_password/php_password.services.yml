  # The first argument of the hashing service (constructor of PhpPassword) is
  # the 'cost' option of password_hash(). In Drupal 8 the 'cost' has the default
  # value used by password_hash() which is 10. Future versions of Drupal may
  # increase this value in order to counteract increases in the speed and power
  # of computers available to crack the hashes. Note that an increase of 1 will
  # double the time needed for password hashing.
