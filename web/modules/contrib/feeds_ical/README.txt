This module provides a Feeds Parser and Feeds Item to allow for the import of content from iCal sources.

The module relies heavily on the johngrogg/ics-parser package which it includes.

Common extensions for iCalendar files are .ical, .ics, .ifb, and .icalendar

This module does not as of yet deal with RRULE occurrences, though the underlying library does, so it would be a matter of adding that functionality to the Feeds Parser.
