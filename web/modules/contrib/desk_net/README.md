== Description ==

Are you using the editorial calendar software Desk-Net to plan your stories and
to manage your editorial department?

This module connects your Desk-Net account to one or multiple Drupal 8 sites.
Your story lists and related meta-data such as statuses are synced both ways
between the two systems.

Two main use-cases are supported:

* Planned content: A article is planned and enriched with meta-data in Desk-Net.
 Based on this Desk-Net automatically creates a article in Drupal. Subsequent
 changes in either system are synced instantly.
* Breaking news: A story originates as a article in Drupal. The plugin sends
  relevant data to Desk-Net ensuring the story lists are complete.

The following meta-data is synced:

* Article description
* Publishing date and time
* Statuses
* Categories
* Author emails
* Slug
* URLs of either system
* Content types

Please note that you need to have an account in Desk-Net to make use of the
plugin.

You are working for an editorial or content marketing team of 15 or more users?
