INTRODUCTION
------------
Quickly integrate and enable AdCoin Payments in Drupal, wherever you need them.
Simply drop them ready-made with the form builder into any page or post with
this powerful plugin by AdCoin Click BV.

With the simple order management module, you can enable payments without complex
e-commerce plugins.
AdCoin is dedicated to making payments better, easier and cheaper.

No need to spend weeks on paperwork or security compliance procedures.
Say goodbye to lost conversions because you don’t support a shopper’s local
payment method, no need to ask for address data or questioning your legitimacy.
We made payments intuitive and safe for merchants and their customers.


------------
INSTALLATION
------------
* First, install the module as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/1897420 for
  further information.

* After having successfully installed the module, you'll want to copy over your
  AdCoin Wallet API key from your AdCoin Wallet:
  To do this, go to the AdCoin Settings page in the Administration menu.
  (The page is either listed vertically as "AdCoin Payments" » "Settings",
  or as "Settings" next to the "Payments" button link in a horizontal menu.)


-------------
CUSTOMIZATION
-------------
* To override the default payment form CSS, you may manually edit the stylesheet
  in "modules/adcoin_payments/css/active.css". The same folder provides a
  "default.css" stylesheet.


---------------
TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Q: Why won't any payments be approved?
A: Receiving AdCoin payments is not possible through a localhost installation if
   the domain is not publicly accessible.
