Form Factory
============

#### Make custom forms... faster.

This module provides a service capable of creating `FormFactory` objects.
The form factory is capable of:
  * loading a `$form` render array
  * appending `FormFactoryKit` objects
  * modifying the loaded `$form` render array based on the given
    `FormFactoryKit` objects
    
For more, please refer to the README in `formfactorykit` module.

Road Map
--------
* implement unit test coverage: confirm arrays generated by `FormFactory` are as expected
