This module requires the jQuery.mmenu library to function.

You can find mmenu here: https://github.com/BeSite/jQuery.mmenu/releases

The module expects the release to be extracted to "jQuery.mmenu", without the
release number in the directory name.

If you have Libraries enabled, a dynamic path will be used. Otherwise, it is
assumed that jQuery.mmenu resides in /libraries/.
