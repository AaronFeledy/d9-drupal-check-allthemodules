INTRODUCTION
------------

Welcome Mail module allows you to send a welcome mail after x amount of time to
new users.

Welcome Mail is often used if you are running a service and want to check in on
how people are doing after a while, and if they have any questions or
improvements.

is why it was developed initially.
