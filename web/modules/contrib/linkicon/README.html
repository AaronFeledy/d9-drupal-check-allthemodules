<h2>LINK ICON</h2>
The Link icon module is a simple link field formatter to create icon classes
based on a predefined set of link titles.

Link icon is an icon-agnostic formatter, meaning it doesn't care for whatever
icon you use. Any icon will simply work. It doesn't hard-code icon names, nor
creates a new field type, nor includes icons.

Drupal supports unlimited values, the limitation is your available icon fonts.

Linkicon is an entity-based field formatter, like link.module, so once you are
done with the Configuration, be sure to visit the assigned entity URL, e.g.:
node/1/edit, or user/1/edit, or inform your members/editors, to add the actual
icons at those URLs.


<h2>FEATURES</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Predefine allowed titles. Adding or removing more icons is as easy as adding
  or removing another line of key|value pairs to the allowed titles.</li>
  <li>Optional icon API, and fontawesome modules integration.</li>
  <li>Optional simple stylings: pure CSS tooltip, square, rounded and base colors,
  or disable it from outputting CSS, if you care to DIY. It's a starter anyway.</li>
  <li>Options to display or hide text, feed icon fonts CSS file, and a few other.</li>
  <li>The tooltip and title may be tokenized.</li>
  <li>And of course, link module own virtues as a field such as effortless
  integration with any fieldable entity.</li>
</ul>

<h2>EXTENDING</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Use Views to place it as blocks, per node or other entity (NID or UID).</li>
  <li>For sitewide social links, an idea is to put the links into admin account
  field, and use Views to make them as sitewide block filtered by admin UID.</li>
  <li>This module doesn't support social share, although with tokenized URL may help
  simple share, it is recommended to use a specialized module for such purpose.</li>
</ul>

<h2>USAGE EXAMPLES</h2>
<ul>
  <li>To create member social links for community-driven sites where you want to
  control what links are allowed.</li>
  <li>To create a set of supported social links for team members so they can put
  their own links without breaking the design, nor your intervention on the fly.</li>
  <li>Static iconized links, e.g.: View website, Try now, Buy now, Demo or other
  Hello there links.</li>
</ul>

<h2>USAGE / CONFIGURATION</h2>
Two important places to visit in the correct orders:
<ul>
  <li>Manage fields</li>
  <li>Manage display</li>
</ul>

Enable this module and its dependency, link.module.

<ol>
  <li>At <em>/admin/config/people/accounts/fields</em>,
  or Content types, hit "<strong>Manage fields</strong>".
    <ul>
      <li>Create a multi-value link field, make sure to choose "Predefined title" and
  input your key|value pairs of titles where key is the icon name (without
  prefix), and value title.
  If you have an icon named "icon-facebook" or "fa-facebook", write, e.g.:
  facebook|Visit my Facebook page
  google-plus|Google+

  Sample with token:
  <code>facebook|Facebook|[node:title]</code>
  The first key translates to icon name "icon-facebook"
  The second to the title.
  The third to tooltip. If not provided, tooltip will use the second if enabled.

  Avoid hardcoding icon name "prefixes" here. The prefix is defined at Display
  formatter so that you are not stuck in database when the icon vendor change
  prefixes from "icon-" to just "fa-", etc. Or you change icon sets.
  Make sure the icon name is available at your icon set.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At <em>/admin/config/people/accounts/fields</em> or Content types, hit "<strong>Manage display</strong>".
    <ul>
      <li>Under "Format" of the active view mode, choose "Link icon, based on title".</li>
      <li>Click the "Configure" icon to have some extra options. There is option to hide
  text so to display icon only, option to disable module from outputting CSS,
  if you want total DIY on theming, and a few other.</li>
      <li>The configuration is ready, now visit the configured entity edit page, e.g.:
  node/1/edit, or user/1/edit, and add the links accordingly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>ADDITIONAL STEPS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Download icon fonts from http://fontello.com or http://icomoon.io/app/.
  Place it somewhere (e.g.: sites/all/libraries/fontawesome), or use icon API
  import, and reference it either via this module Display formatter, or your
  theme, or loaded automatically if using fontawesome.module or icon API.</li>
  <li>Define path to icon font library at admin/config/user-interface/linkicon</li>
</ul>

<h2>REQUIREMENTS</h2>
- link.module (in core) should be enabled.


<h2>RELATED MODULES</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Follow
https://drupal.org/project/follow
It adds sitewide and per user links that link to various social networking
sites. The links reside in two blocks.</li>
  <li>Link favicon formatter
https://drupal.org/project/link_favicon_formatter
Adds a formatter to the link field that adds the host favicon to the front of
the link.</li>
  <li>Advanced link
https://drupal.org/project/advanced_link
Option to allow users select url title from predefined list of values, but
nothing to do with icons. Linkicon owes credit to it for the idea on turning
texfield into select box within the allowed titles, however since Advanced link
builds another widget type, which Linkicon disagrees, Linkicon can not extend
and depend on it. Linkicon chooses to alter the link field widget instead.</li>
</ul>

<h2>RECOMMENDED MODULES</h2>
Icon providers based on icon API module.
<ul>
  <li>https://drupal.org/project/icon</li>
  <li>https://drupal.org/project/fontawesome</li>
  <li>https://drupal.org/project/icomoon</li>
</ul>

<h2>SAMPLE OPTIONS</h2>
Based on Fontawesome via fontello.com.
If not via fontello.com, Fontawesome may have class google-plus, not gplus.
Basically, adjust the icon names accordingly.

<code>
facebook|Facebook
twitter|Twitter
flickr|Flickr
github|Github
gplus|Google +
html5|HTML5
linkedin|Linkedin
pinterest|Pinterest
vimeo|Vimeo
youtube|Youtube
delicious|Delicious
</code>

<h2>KNOWN ISSUES</h2>
If using Views Fields under "Format", be sure to check "Use field template"
under "Style settings", otherwise empty result.
