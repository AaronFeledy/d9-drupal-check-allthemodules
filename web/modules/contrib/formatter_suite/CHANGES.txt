@par 9/10/2018, Version 0.1.0
Initial internal release.


@par 9/24/2018, Version 0.2.0
First drupal.org release.

New features:
  - Extended bytes formatter to add a UI and a choice of units (KB or KiB),
    whether to show full words (Kilobyte or KB), and the number of decimal
    digits in the result.
  - Added rendered entity reference list formatter.

Administrative:
  - Updated help page to list all formatters, including images.
  - Updated formatter and help banner styling.
  - Removed logo footer on help and module settings pages.
  - Updated help page text.


@par 11/28/2018, Version 0.2.1
Bug fix release.

Bugs:
  - A problem in GeneralNumberFormatter caused values like "39.99" to be
    displayed as "39.100" due to a quirk of the PHP ceil() function used
    to create the formatted digits after the decimal. This has been corrected
    to use the PHP round() function instead.
  - A problem in GeneralNumberFormatter caused error log entries about an
    undefined index "numeralBase" at several points in the code. This would
    cause some validation to fail and numeral formatting to possibly produce
    incorrect results. This has been corrected to use the correct "numberBase"
    index.
  - A problem in ImageEmbedDataFormatter referenced a standard Image module
    theme that, in turn, tried to reference a theme include file that could
    not be used directly by FormatterSuite. This caused odd error messages in
    the site log, but had no other impact. The problem has been fixed.

Administrative:
  - Code:
    - Misc code updates to satisfy Drupal's PHP and JavaScript code style
      scanning. This has no effect on functionality. It just removes automatic
      Drupal style complaints.


@par 3/27/2019, Version 0.3.0
Update with new features for links, files, and images.

Bugs:
  - Fixed problem where General Entity Reference would crash with an access
    error if the link title were set to be the entity ID.
  - When showing lists for multi-value fields, the item separator is no longer
    included for numbered, bulleted, or block lists.
  - Reduced module's dependencies to just Field and System, intentionally
    omitting dependencies on the field types for which there are formatters.
    If a field type is not enabled at a website, the associated formatter
    plugins are ignored by Drupal. Adding field type dependencies is not
    needed.

Deprecated:
  - The General Entity Reference List formatter is deprecated. List handling
    is now supported by the parent General Entity Reference formatter.
  - The General Email List formatter is deprecated. List handling
    is now supported by the parent General Email formatter.
  - The General Number List formatter is deprecated. List handling
    is now supported by the parent General Number formatter.

New features:
  - Added General Link formatter for link fields. It supports HTML5 link
    attributes, including "rel", "target", "download", and link topic.
    These support "noreferrer", "noopener", and "nofollow", as well links
    that trigger a download or open in a new tab.
  - Added General File Link formatter for links to local files. It supports
    a subset of HTML5 link attributes appropriate for local file links.
  - Added General Image formatter for image fields. It supports a subset of
    HTML5 link attributes appropriate for local image links, plus a caption
    above or below the image.
  - Updated General Entity Reference formatter to support HTML5 link attributes
    as for General Link. Only attributes appropriate for internal links are
    available.
  - Updated General Entity Reference formatter to support multi-value fields
    and several ways to show them in a list. This feature used to be in the
    now-deprecated General Entity Reference List formatter.
  - Updated General Number formatter to support multi-value fields
    and several ways to show them in a list. This feature used to be in the
    now-deprecated General Number List formatter.

Administrative:
  - Help:
    - Updated module help.
    - Updated formatter UI images in help.
  - UI:
    - Adjusted UI layout and styling throughout.
