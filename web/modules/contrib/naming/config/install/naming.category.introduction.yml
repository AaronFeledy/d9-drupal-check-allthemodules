    <p>Why?</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Developers should never have to think about what to name something.</li>
    <li>Predictable names can make it easier to share data with other applications via Drupal's REST API.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>General Concepts</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Keep it simple</li>
    <li>Avoid abbreviations</li>
    <li>Be consistent</li>
    <li>Name things from general to specific</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Exceptions</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Field names are limited to 32 characters, therefore field names may have to contain abbreviations.</li>
    <li>Namespaces should be as short as possible.</li>
    <li>Names that are visible to end users should be short and simple.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Tips</p>
    <ul>
    <li>When in doubt look at /core for D8's recommended naming conventions.</li>
    <li>Avoid using Drupal's default automatically generated machine names.</li>
    </ul>
