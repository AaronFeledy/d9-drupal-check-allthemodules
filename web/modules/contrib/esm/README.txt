REQUIREMENTS
------------
* Field Group Module has to be installed

Note: This module works best with Seven Theme and comes with default styling which can be overriden. Only desktop and
tablet viewport is supported.

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module.
   See: https://www.drupal.org/node/895232 for further information.

   It is highly recommended to install "Editor Sidebar Menu" using Composer so its
   dependencies can be installed automatically.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

ESM introduces a new fieldgroup formatter "Area" which allows you to configure sidebar menu items.
You can create a label and add an ID and additional CSS classes. This is useful to add fontawesome-icons
to your sidebar menu entry.
