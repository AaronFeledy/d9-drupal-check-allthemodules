IP Ban Module
====================

Description
-----------

A large majority of all websites have content that's only relevant to a country 
or region. This can be problematic because visitors from other countries or 
regions may not exactly be visiting your site with your best interests in mind. 

This module allows you configure the site to be "read only" or "complete ban" 
for a visitor based on individual IP addresses or by country (using IP address 
lookup).  

For complete bans, you can redirect the user to any page you choose and/or 
display an "error" message. There is nothing preventing you from entering an 
external address as the page to redirect to.

"Read only" will allow you to disable blocks for visitors from a country or IP 
address set to "Read only", and disallows access to all /user pages. If you also
need to disable forms, it is recommended you install the Read only mode module.

Combined with a sensible use of block visibility on the pages you redirect to 
for blocks containing menus,  phone numbers, etc., you should be able to 
effectively block out unwanted contacts.
