# Views Inject Results

This module allows injecting results from one views display into another display
of the same view with configurable spacing. This allows you to build views
where, for example, every third row is a blog post while all others are
articles, or where every nth row shows an advertisement.

## Installation

Download and enable the module.

## Configuration

Edit the view display of your choice that should have other results injected.
The center area should have a section "Inject Results" where you can alter the
module's settings for this view. These settings only apply to the currently
edited display of the view.
