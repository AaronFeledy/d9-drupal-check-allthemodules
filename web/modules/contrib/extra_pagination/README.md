#Extra Pagination

##Description

Extra Pagination is a very simple module that provides a new set of pager 
items between the last visible pager link and the maximum pager number. 
This is mainly done for SEO reasons to make us reach any page in 3-4 
clicks maximum. Suggestions and feature requests are welcome.

## Installation and requirements
No setup required. Once you install the module, the extra pager items will 
appear.
