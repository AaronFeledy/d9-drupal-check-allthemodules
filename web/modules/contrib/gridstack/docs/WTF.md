## GRIDSTACK IN A NUTSHELL
Gridstack is a layout factory/ creator. Similar to how you create layouts by
code, only with Gridstack, you create layouts with a drag and drop.

It is capable of building the most complex layouts you can imagine visually
right in the browser. Call it designing layouts on the browser.

Even if you love coding everything by hand, you will soon find Gridstack handy
for various reasons:

* configurability,
* exportability,
* easy integration with various layout builders,
* easy modification to suit your heart contents,
* etc.

**Gridstack layouts come in two flavors:**

1. **The css-driven layouts**

   Integrates with Bootstrap or Foundation CSS frameworks.
   Hence Gridstack is useless till you install one of the layout builders which
   can make use of Gridstack layouts:

   Display Suite, Panels, Layout Builder, Widget, etc.

   No Gridstack CSS and JS are loaded. You must have a theme or module which
   load the grid CSS framework for you.

2. **The js-driven layouts**

   Gridstack has formatters and Views style plugins to build magazine layouts.

Both layout flavors are usable for Display Suite, Panels, Layout Builder, etc.
Region or wrapper attributes, including their HTML tags are configurable via
Layout builder for both flavors.
