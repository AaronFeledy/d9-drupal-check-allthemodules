INTRODUCTION
------------

The Custom add content page module allows the user to customize the "add
content" page by converting it to a hierarchical menu named "Custom add content
page". By configuring this menu the user will be able to:

 * Sort creation links and establish a hierarchy
 * Hide creation links

When a content type is created or deleted the menu is automatically updated.
