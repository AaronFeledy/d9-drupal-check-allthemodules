INTRODUCTION
------------

This module integrates WIRIS Editor into CKEditor. WIRIS is the leading equation editor for web-based platforms. It adds ability to insert math and chemistry equations — using MathType and ChemType — into your CKEditor.

WIRIS Editor generates the equation using [MathML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML), but it doesn't handle the rendering. In order to view the formula in your content, you must use a rendering solution such as [MathJax](https://www.drupal.org/project/mathjax).

REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires CKEditor from core.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install the module [as usual](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/extending-drupal-8/installing-drupal-8-modules).

CONFIGURATION
-------------

Go to **Text formats and editors** (`admin/config/content/formats`), then add the MathType and/or ChemType into your editor.
