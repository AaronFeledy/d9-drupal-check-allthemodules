# In order to to create pages it is necessary to define routes for them. A route
# maps a URL path to a controller. It defines with what function or method will
# be called when a URL is accessed. The following lines defines three of them
# for this module.

# Menu items corresponding to these URLs are defined separately in the
# sadb.menu_links.yml file.

# If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=examples/page-example, the routing
# system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will find a
# match, and execute the _controller callback. In this case the callback is
# defined as a classname
# ("\Drupal\sadb\Controller\PageExampleController") and a method
# ("description").

# Access to this path is not restricted. This is notated as _access: 'TRUE'.
sadb_description:
  path: 'sadb/page-example'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\sadb\Controller\Tests::description'
    _title: 'Page Example'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'access content'

# If the user accesses http://example.com/?q=examples/page-example/simple,
# the routing system will look for a route with that path. In this case it will
# find a match, and execute the _controller callback. Access to this path
# requires "access simple page" permission.
sadb_simple:
  path: 'sadb/tests'
  defaults:
    _controller: '\Drupal\sadb\Controller\Tests::tests'
    _title: 'SADB - Tests'
