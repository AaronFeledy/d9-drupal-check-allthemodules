# Gender field

The gender field module provides inclusive options for collecting gender
information of individuals.

"This is not an area that we often have to give thought to, but it is also not
complicated if we approach the user experience with empathy and consideration
for the sensitive situations we may put our users in." --Zoe Gagnon
