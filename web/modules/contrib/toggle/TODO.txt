- implement field formatter with no ajax stuff yet
- formatter for entity/term reference fields
- views integration, add sortable field & filter handlers
- implement ajax stuff for both widget, formatter and also for elements, using
  extra #params
- generic handling of boolean entity properties?
- enforce certain number of selections when cardinality > 1; default is pick as
  many as you want and let validation take care of it, maybe it's best left alone
