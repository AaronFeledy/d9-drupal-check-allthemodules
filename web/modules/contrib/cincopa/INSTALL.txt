REQUIREMENTS
------------

  * Drupal 8.x
  * A Cincopa.com account (free & paid versions available!)

INSTALLATION
------------

1. Install Cincopa module
   
   Unpack the module in your site's module directory. Then browse to "Administration" -> "Extend" and enable the module. (It's in the "Input Filters" section)
   
2. Configure the input filter

   To get the module to function, you'll need to add the Cincopa Filter
   to every Input Format you wish to use it with.
   
   To do so:
     1. Visit the "Input Formats" page (Administration -> Configuration -> Content authoring)
     2. Click "Configure" for the desired Input Format
     3. Mark the checkbox next to "Parse Cincopa Tags" (Inside the "Enabled Filters")
     4. Click on "Save configuration"
   
   And that's it!
   You can now use the [cincopa 123456789] tag on every node which uses the
   Input Format you've attached the Cincopa Filter to.
