Chessboard Module
=================

This module renders chessboard diagrams specified with the FEN syntax
or a simple piece placement format.

Installation
------------
1. Copy all files in this directory to sites/all/modules/chessboard/... (i.e., a
   directory named 'chessboard' inside the Drupal sites/all/modules/ directory).
2. Activate the module on your admin/modules page.

Usage
-----
The Chessboard Filter module adds a chessboard diagram filter to your site, for
use with text formats. This filter adds the ability to use chessboard diagrams
in any text field that uses a text format (such as the body of a content item or
the text of a comment).
Help is available on your admin/help/chessboard_filter page.

Miscellaneous
-------------
The default piece images are obtained from:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Chess_image
They are made from xboard (GPL-ed) and are freely redistributable.
The border images are made by vyvee.
