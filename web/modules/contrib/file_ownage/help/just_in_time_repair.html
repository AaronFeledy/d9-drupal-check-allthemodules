    Automated find & repair of missing files (Just-in-time)
</h1>

<p>
    For migrates gone-wrong, or other unpredicted and unwanted situations,
    the system may believe that files should be in places where they are not.

    The just-in-time mode of this module can identify failed file requests,
    and then use some rules to try and find the missing file.

    As configured in the file_ownage settings,
    This could be from a nearby directory, a nested subfolder, recursive directory scans,
    or a remote web request and fetch.
    The idea being that if the file is not where it was expected, we look in a number of other places
    to fill it in, then patch up the system and the problem has gone.
</p>

<p>
    When this process runs in just-in-time mode, it leverages (and requires) the
    stage_file_proxy module.
    This module extends and overrides stage_file_proxy behaviour so that instead of just 'fetching' the expected file
    from a nominated remote server, we search in a few extra places in a few extra ways.
</p>
<p>
    Internally, this module replaces the 'service' that stage_file_proxy uses to 'fetch' things.
