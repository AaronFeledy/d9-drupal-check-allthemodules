INTRODUCTION
------------

This module shows menus, nodes, blocks and taxonomy with source
and target language side by side e.g. to provide a translation template for
an external translation/review/release workflow. All string and text
field types are supported, as well as image (alt) and link (title). Fields are 
listed in default display order first and then all other fields. Works
with fields in paragraphs, field_collections and field_group.
