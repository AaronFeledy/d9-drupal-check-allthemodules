Prefetch Cache 8.x-1.0-alpha4, 2016-05-02
----------------------------
[] hchonov: Removed the version property from prefetch_cache.info.yml as it
            will be filled in by the packaging script.

Prefetch Cache 8.x-1.0-alpha3, 2015-07-28
----------------------------
[] hchonov: The JS library does not have to remove the X-Requested-With HTTP
            header anymore on JQuery.ajax requests.
[] hchonov: Now removing the prefetch cache query parameters also from
            REQUEST_URI, because it is used to generate the link for
            form['#action'] and we do not want to post a form on submission
            to the url for requesting the form to be cached by prefetch cache.

Prefetch Cache 8.x-1.0-alpha2, 2015-07-10
----------------------------
[] hchonov: loading the prefetch_cache.process_links library on all pages.
