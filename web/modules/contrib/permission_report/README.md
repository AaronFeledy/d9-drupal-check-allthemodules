About this module
-----------------

This module lets you drill down into permissions much more deeply than the     
existing tools allow. You can find which users have which permissions and for
large deployments or which role a user has gives them a particular permission.

Much of the functionality of this module was modeled after Active Directory's 
RSOP functionality which, for any given user, allows you to see the _Resultant
Set of Permissions_.


Using this module
-----------------

To use this module, simply enable it and then view the available reports. Links
are available on user's profile pages and reports on individual roles and user
permissions are available via the administrative permissions area. You can give
a user the "view permission report" permission to allow them to see these these
reports. If the user can manage permissions, they will have links allowing them
to do so.
