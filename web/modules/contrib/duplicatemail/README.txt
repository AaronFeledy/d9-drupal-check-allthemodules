-- SUMMARY --

The Duplicate Mail module has a block to display system wide duplicate email
addresses in user accounts, and a view with a block display for use on
individual user account pages that displays only the accounts that have the same
email address as that account.

-- REQUIREMENTS --

Views module.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Install as usual, see http://drupal.org/node/70151 for further information.


-- CONFIGURATION --

* This module lists user account information, including email addresses.
  Restrict access to this information by configuring the blocks to only display
  for a siteadmin type of role. (Picking a role other than anonymous or
  authenticated will make it so anonymous or simple authenticated users cannot
  see the blocks.) Configure block role visibility in Administer >> Site
  Building >> Blocks and configure the Duplicate Mail blocks under Role specific
  visibility settings. 

  Also, change the region from Disabled to some other region. Right sidebar
  works well for the system wide block. And content or content top works well
  for the individual block generated by views.
  

-- TROUBLESHOOTING --

* If the blocks do not display, check the following:

  - Make sure you save the block settings page after moving the blocks to a new
    region.


-- FAQ --

Q: It's impossible to get accounts with duplicate emails; why have this module?

A: There are a few modules that bypass that safeguard and allow duplicate
   emails.  And, during an import of users using the migrate module, accounts
   can be created using emails already in use by other accounts. 

   This module is useful for listing only the accounts with duplicate emails
   so that the users can be contacted to correct the situation, the accounts can
   be merged, or just for information purposes to find out how many duplicates
   there are.
