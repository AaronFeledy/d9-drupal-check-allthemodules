This very small module extends the "Default Quantity = 0" functionality to the shopping cart, preventing customers from changing their quantity by disabling the quantity field in the shopping cart.

The "add to cart" form had disabled the quantity field, but in some cases buyers mistakenly bump the quantity before checkout.

Our use case is class registrations, where we want unique information per attendee.

For Drupal 8 only. Either install and enable the module or just copy the code into your custom module.

It is necessary to set a product's Default Quantity to zero. You'll likely have to move the default quantity field from "hidden" to "visible" on the content type's structure for the edit form.
