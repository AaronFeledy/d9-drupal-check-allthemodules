# Import taxonomy terms for existing vocabularies.
#
# Taxonomy is imported in vocabulary/term pairs. Up to 3 pairs per row can be
# imported with this migration. The text in the vocabulary column is expected to
# the be the same for that entire column. The term should be whatever is
# required for the product variation in that row.
#
# The vocabulary/term pair will only be saved when both values are not empty.
#
# Destination site configuration:
#   - Install the Taxonomy Module.
#   - Create the vocabularies.
