I watched the games yesterday [Sunday] and you have to be completely focused for 90 minutes.""</p><p>Wenger says that the nature of the transfer market has changed a great deal since he came to England in 1996.</p><p>""The market has been difficult for two reasons,"" he explained.

Now, everybody knows everybody and it is more difficult.""</p>","wenger.jpg",1,0
