INTRODUCTION
------------

The Route Path Rewrite module changes the paths of configured routes. The routes are configured with the Drupal route name (described as **machine name** in the [structure of routes documentation](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/routing-system/structure-of-routes)), for example the login: **user.login**.

      # The name of the key, here "user_login" does not matter, example config for the user login:

        name: 'user.login'
        new_path: '/backend-login'
      user_login_http:
        name: 'user.login.http'
