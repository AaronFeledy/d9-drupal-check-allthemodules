REQUIREMENTS

INSTALLATION
------------
Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
for further information.


CONFIGURATION
-------------

- It is highly recommended to not use user 1 when managing micro sites with
 nodes, or any user with the permission "bypass node access". Otherwise, these
 users will see any nodes published on any micro sites. You should create at
 least another admin like role, role which do not have this permission.
