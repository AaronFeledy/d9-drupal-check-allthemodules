INTRODUCTION
------------

Users sometimes forget their usernames. Username Reminder provides a form for
requesting a username reminder, which is linked from the user login block and
the user page. The user who has forgotten their username can enter their email
address into the form, and if it matches an active account, the account
username is emailed to the email address.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

No special requirements.


INSTALLATION
------------

Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. For further
information, visit:

CONFIGURATION
-------------

The subject and body of the reminder email are customizable via Administration
» Configuration » People » Username Reminder. Token replacements are
supported.
