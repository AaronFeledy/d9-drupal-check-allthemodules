# Imagepin

A module for pinning widgets on images

## Quick start

- Install this module.
- Go to the "Manage display" section of your content type and choose
  the view mode where you'd like the pins to be displayed.
- This module gives you the option for enabling users to pin widgets
  for the Image and Responsive image formatter. Enable it as you like.
- Choose a proper image style for dragging the pins around,
  and optionally set a breakpoint for mobile and desktop resolutions.
- Editors now get a link on image fields for pinning widgets on each uploaded image.
- Create your widgets, drag their pins on the image, and save the positions.
- View your content.

## Extensible

- Define your own and specific widgets as Drupal plugins.
- You can adjust the frontend behavior to your specific needs with further Javascript extensions. Take a look at the Slick extension to see how you can create your own.

## Enhancements

When Slick is installed (https://drupal.org/project/slick), the Imagepin
module automatically displays your widgets as a swipable carousel.
