Entity edit redirect.
================================================================================

Module allows you to redirect to external edit url when accessing Drupal's
regular entity edit route (entity edit form page). This may be useful if you
distribute the content from one main instance (contentpool) to your secondary
instances (satellites). If you want to redirect editing of the content to the
main instance only then this module is for you.

It contains configurable list of entity types (or even their bundles) and their
corresponding paths. You may configure one general path for all of your nodes
or you can granularize it per bundle (article and page bundle having their own
paths).
