# Search API Swiftype

The _Search API Swiftype_ module integrates the _Swiftype_ search engine into
your Drupal site.

## Installation

Simply download the module from [Drupal.org][1] and follow the instructions on
[Installing Drupal 8 Modules][2].

## Limitations

### Sorting

At the moment, _Swiftype_ allows to sort by one field only. Having multiple
sorts in you result list is therefore not possible.
