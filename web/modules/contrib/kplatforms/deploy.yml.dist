# Is aegir / provision is set to true then an aegir platform will be created
# and an importation into the frontend queued. This assumes the user connecting
# is the correct user for managing aegir, and that the hostmaster is available
# by the drush alias @hostmaster
# The platform alias takes the basename & date and strips underscores, dashes,
# and periods.
