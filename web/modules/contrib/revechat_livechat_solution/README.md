INTRODUCTION

In the fast paced ambience of live customer support, the efficient usage of 
valuable time is the main key to both happy customers and professional
management. Traditionally interactions between support agents and customers
have been restricted to one-on-one supports over phones or emails. Live chat 
for customer support has now become the alternative that today’s multitasking 
and net savvy generation is looking for. It offers quick response in 
real time and higher customer satisfaction which can generate more 
conversions. In the era of  automated customer assistance systems, 
the chance to chat with a person in real time through your website 
is a distinct feature. Now just like a sales person in the shop, talk
to the visitors of your website in real-time. 
REVE Chat is powerful and intuitive real-time customer engagement 
software. It puts a live person on your website to personally 
guide and help your visitors, while they go through the various 
sections of your digital display. This helps them to get the most 
out of your web presence, while allowing you to understand their 
diverse needs on a one-to-one basis. REVE Chat is easy to install and
