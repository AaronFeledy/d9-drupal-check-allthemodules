---SUMMARY---

This module establishes a connection between Drupal Commerce and the "Szamla 
Agent" on https://szamlazz.hu. The module allows you to automatically create
invoices for products purchased in your Drupal Commerce based webshop.


---INTRODUCTION---


There are many options for this module to be used as widely as possible. Before 
using it in a production environment, be sure to try it out in your test 
environment. Create a new account at szamlazz.hu, the tax number should be
11111111-1-11. Ask customer support to set up your account to test mode. Install 
the module in your test environment and set it up as you should. Of course, 
setup your username and password for your test account at szamlazz.hu. Buy in 
the test environment and see if everything is fine with the invoices you are 
preparing. If you find everything right, install the module on your production
site, but use your live username and password. If you find a bug, please
create a new issue.


---REQUIREMENTS---


A szamlazz.hu account, a Drupal Commerce based webshop and if you want to send 
the invoices to the customers, then an HTML mail system, such as Swift Mailer. 
This is not included in the module dependencies, because it works without it. 
Attaching the invoice to the outgoing mail is only created when a required 
HTML mailer module is installed.


---INSTALLATION---


Install as usual. Place the entirety of this directory in the /modules 
folder of your Drupal installation. 


---CONFIGURATION---


Set up the right behavior for you on admin/commerce/config/invoice_agent.
