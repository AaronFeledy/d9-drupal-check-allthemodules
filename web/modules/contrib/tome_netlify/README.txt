USE
===

Tome Netlify provides the following features:

* Generation of the Netlify _redirects file. When a redirect is generated by
  Tome Static, this module will write an equivalent line to a file named
  "_redirects" in the root of your static export directory.
* Send Contact form submissions to Netlify. With the "Contact" module enabled,
  you can edit any Contact form and enable Netlify submission by checking the
  "Submit form to Netlify" checkbox. Support for Netlify's built in honeypot
  and reCAPTCHA features can also be enabled per form.
