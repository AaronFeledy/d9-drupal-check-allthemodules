The global settings for installed plug-in modules are accessed via the <strong>"Manage Plug-ins"</strong> tab.

On the settings page, the plug-in modules available are listed under each available domain on the left side. To access the settings, click on the desired plug-in module's name and the form will be presented.

<h4>Enabling/Disabling the Plug-in</h4>
The output for each plug-in can be turned on/off by clicking the top checkbox at the top of the form for the plug-in settings being viewed. This allows admins to toggle the output without having to manage the module in the Drupal Modules page and not lose any settings. Clicking the <strong>"Save"</strong> at the bottom is not required for this toggle option.

<h4>Settings Form</h4>
When you have selected the plug-in to manage settings for, the form will be presented. Enter the required data within the form for the desired plug-in and when you have completed the form, click <strong>"Save"</strong> at the bottom to confirm and save those settings.

Upon saving, only the current presented form will be saved. If entered data on another form and then switched to the current form the data entered on the previous form will have been lost.
