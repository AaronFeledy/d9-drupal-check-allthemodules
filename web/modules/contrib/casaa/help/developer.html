Custom plug-in modules can be created for CASAA to manage any third-party service that needs to have varying values across the site.

Plug-in modules can be created the same as any other module.

<h4>Required Files</h4>
A plug-in for CASAA requires only three basic files to work with the framework:
<ul>
	<li>*.info</li>
	<li>*.install</li>
	<li>*.module</li>
</ul>

<h4>API Overview</h4>
The developer's API is a collection of functions and hooks to be used to manage the plug-in's data and output within the framework. Similar to building custom fields for CCK, CASAA's API is centered around defining the elements of the plug-in to the framework and allowing the framework to handle the bulk of data management. The plug-in only needs to define how it's data looks and how it's presented. CASAA handle's all the grunt-work in storing the data and determining when it should be displayed.

The API is broken down into four main divisions:
<ul>
	<li>Plug-in Registry</li>
	<li>Global Settings</li>
	<li>Mapping Settings</li>
	<li>Output and Display</li>
</ul>

As long as all of the required hooks and other functions are present the rest is up to the developer. CASAA will handle the rest.
