Context Ad Serving and Analytics is a base framework that can be extended to support third-party services for ad serving and metrics.
The advantage of the framework is to allow the management of these services under a single interface as well as map various values across the site using URL paths, taxonomy, and (soon) context to give admins the ability to more deeply track their site and manage advertising campaigns.

The framework can also interact with the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/domain">Domain Access</a> module to allow you services to be mapped across multiple domains managed with Domain Access within the same interface as well.

Also, the framework supplies an API for developers to build plug-in modules for any custom systems they use or even customize plug-in modules to fit their needs more specifically.

Examples of such systems would be: Omniture Site Catalyst, Yahoo! APT, Open Ad Stream, Google Analytics.
