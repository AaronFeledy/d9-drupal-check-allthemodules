To create a mapping in the system after you have chosen which type you would like to create, click on the plug sign (+) within the box for the desired type. You will presented with a form wizard that will direct you through the steps in creating your mapping.

<h4>Creating Taxonomy Mappings</h4>
Click the plus sign (+) in the area next to "Taxonomy Mappings." 

When the wizard appears, you will first be asked to select the vocabulary that you will be choosing terms from. In the next step, you will be able to select a term from the previously chosen vocabulary.

The last step will present the individual forms for each plug-in module/system that is installed where you may enter the values for each to be applied in the mapping that you are creating.

<h4>Creating Path Mappings</h4>
Click the plus sign (+) in the area next to "Path Mappings."

When the wizard appears, you will first be asked to enter the path for the URL that you wish to map. When adding a path mapping you should always omit the leading slash e.g. <strong>"/news"</strong> should be entered as <strong>"news"</strong>.

To wildcard a path, add a forward slash <strong>/</strong> and an star (<strong>*</strong>) at the end of the path to accept that base path and all sub-paths underneath it. Wildcarded paths such as, <strong>news/*/sub</strong> are not accepted.

There are also two tokens that can be used. <strong>[front]</strong> and <strong>[404]</strong> should be used to represent the frontpage of your site and 404 pages.

The last step will present the individual forms for each plug-in module/system that is installed where you may enter the values for each to be applied in the mapping that you are creating.
