CASAA gives admins the ability to manage the mappings already created in the system. You can view all of the mappings for a mapping type by selecting <strong>"View All"</strong> from underneath the mapping type.

After you make your selection, you will be presented with a window displaying all of the mappings for that type. For each type in the system there are options you may choose to either edit/configure or delete the mapping.

Choosing <strong>"Configure"</strong> will present the form containing the sub-forms of all the installed plug-in modules and their values to be edited.

Choosing <strong>"Delete"</strong> will completely remove the mapping from the system. This action can not be undone.

<h4>Managing Domains</h4>
If your site is using the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/domain">Domain Access</a> module, CASAA allows you to be able to manage mappings over each domain.

In the interface, each domain is displayed on the left side. The settings displayed are representative of the active domain which will be highlighted on the left side. To change domains being edited click on the desired domain on the left side.

All of the interface options shown pertain to the highlighted domain.
