CASAA applies values for installed services by applying mappings or as some refer to them, tags, via two main methods:
<ul>
	<li>Taxonomy Terms</li>
	<li>URL Paths</li>
</ul>

The system uses these to be able to apply values for stand-alone pages, node-level content, and front pages.

<h3>Mapping Hierarchy</h3>
Choosing which type of mapping to use should be based on what type of content and what level the content is within the site. Understanding the hierarchy of mappings as to how they relate to content hierarchy will help in making the choice.

<h4>URL Paths</h4>
URL path mappings are the highest level in the mapping hierarchy. By using the url path for a mapping, you are directly tagging a page or piece of content. 

For instance, you have a page with the path, <strong>example.com/news</strong>. By applying "news" as the path for the mapping in CASAA you have now tagged that page directly for the values that you wish to apply. No other page will receive those values.

URL mappings can be strict or wildcarded with the use of the <strong>'*'</strong> symbol.

Take the above example again. If we were to apply a wildcard to the same path as such, <strong>news/*</strong>, we would now be applying our mapping to all content that falls under the <strong>/news</strong> path. As in, <strong>example.com/news/local</strong>, would now receive the mapping as it is a sub to the <strong>news/*</strong> path.

<h4>Taxonomy Terms</h4>
Taxonomy term mappings are the next level down from URL mappings. Tax terms are used to apply tags to story/node level in a bulk sense. Applying tags to individual pieces of content can be tedious when there a large amounts of content. So, by using taxonomy as a mapping type, admins bulk tag all of the content by using this type of mapping.

<h4>Caveats of Using Wildcarded Paths over Taxonomy</h4>
Now there are some things to remember when using both wildcarded paths and taxonomy mappings. In the CASAA hierarchy, path mapping take precedence over taxonomy mappings. 

So, for example, we have a node, with the URL <strong>example.com/news/local/story1</strong> and the node/story has the taxonomy term, <strong>News</strong>. In CASAA, you have the mappings, <strong>news/*</strong> for the path mapping and <strong>News</strong> for the taxonomy mapping. In this case, the path mapping overrides the taxonomy mapping.
