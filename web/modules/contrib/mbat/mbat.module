<h5>
MBAT is like "Menu Breadcrumb" except that taxonomy members
are breadcrumbed as if they were menu children.
</h5>
<p>
Behaviour & implementation are similar to Menu Breadcrumb except that
nodes will be checked for taxonomy entity reference fields and,
if any taxonomy terms they contain are posted on a menu,
they will inherit that taxonomy page's breadcrumbs.
</p>
<p>
It implements the configurable options of Menu Breadcrumb to help make it
as close as possible to a behavioural replacement for that module, while
also well suited for sites with category blogs implemented as taxonomy terms.
</p>
<p>
Whether taxonomies are nested or not, the breadcrumbs will reflect the menus
only and NOT the any hierarchy within the taxonomy: yet if those taxonomy terms
are posted in a hierarchical menu then they will breadcrumb in the same way.
For menus based automatically on a taxonomy hierarchy,
with breadcrumbs reflecting the same hierarchy,
you could use the Taxonomy Menu module.
</p>
<h5>
Implementation Notes
</h5>
<p>
If the current page exists on more than one menu,
or has more than one possible taxonomy attachment,
it uses the first box selected in the ordered list of menus.
The order in which menus are scanned can be changed by
dragging &amp; dropping the menus on that list.
</p>
<p>
Taxonomy terms are searched in the order that their entity reference fields
appear in the current page's field listing.
One way to change an unwanted taxonomy term taking precendence over the one
you want to "attach" on would be to change the order of those fields.
</p>
</p>

    case 'mbat.settings':
      $output = <<<EOT
<p>
Select the first option to enable the MBAT module,
which will generate a breadcrumb trail the first match
in the selected menu below: first looking for the current page on a menu,
and then seeing if the current page belongs to a taxonomy on that menu
(whose breadcrumbs it will then inherit).
</p>
<p>
If MBAT cannot find a menu path or a taxonomy-based path for the current page,
a breadcrumb will neither be generated nor cached and another breadcrumb builder
(e.g., the default path-based breadcrumb builder)
will be free to set the breadcrumb.
